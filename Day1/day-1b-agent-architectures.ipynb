Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

By embracing this paradigm, software developers can unlock new levels of innovation and create solutions that were once thought impossible.\nWriterAgent > ## Unlock Smarter Software: How Multi-Agent Systems Revolutionize Development\n\nImagine your software not just executing commands, but actively collaborating, adapting, and problem-solving. That's the power of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and for software developers, it's a paradigm shift that can lead to more robust, intelligent, and efficient applications.\n\nAt its core, MAS involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, specialized \"agents.\" Think of it like assembling a crack team where each member has a unique skill set. These agents don't work in isolation; they communicate, share information, and coordinate actions to achieve a common goal. This allows for emergent intelligence and a system that can adapt to changing environments.\n\nFor developers, this translates into significant benefits. MAS dramatically enhances **modularity and maintainability**. Smaller, independent agents are easier to develop, test, and debug, meaning updates to one agent are less likely to break the entire system. Furthermore, MAS boosts **robustness and resilience**. If one agent fails, others can often compensate, making the overall system more fault-tolerant. This collaborative approach can also **accelerate development cycles**, as teams can work on different agents concurrently, and pre-built agent frameworks streamline the process.\n\nWe're already seeing MAS shine in complex simulations, intelligent control systems for autonomous vehicles and smart grids, and in data analysis and optimization across various industries. Ready to explore? Start by familiarizing yourself with agent frameworks like JADE or AgentPy, identify problems that benefit from decomposition and collaboration, and begin with small, iterative projects. Embracing MAS means building software that is intelligent, adaptable, and truly revolutionary.\nEditorAgent > ## Unlock Smarter Software: How Multi-Agent Systems Revolutionize Development\n\nImagine your software not just executing commands, but actively collaborating, adapting, and problem-solving. That's the power of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and for software developers, it represents a significant paradigm shift capable of yielding more robust, intelligent, and efficient applications.\n\nAt its core, MAS involves decomposing complex problems into smaller, specialized \"agents.\" Think of it like assembling a crack team where each member possesses a unique skill set. Crucially, these agents don't operate in isolation; they communicate, share information, and coordinate their actions to achieve a common objective. This collaborative approach fosters emergent intelligence and enables the system as a whole to adapt to changing environments.\n\nFor developers, this translates into tangible benefits. MAS dramatically enhances **modularity and maintainability**. Smaller, independent agents are inherently easier to develop, test, and debug. Consequently, updates to a single agent are far less likely to disrupt the entire system, significantly improving its long-term manageability. Furthermore, MAS bolsters **robustness and resilience**. Should one agent encounter a failure, other agents can often compensate or assume its responsibilities, making the overall system more fault-tolerant. This collaborative nature can also **accelerate development cycles**. Teams can work on different agents concurrently, and the availability of pre-built agent frameworks further streamlines the development process.\n\nWe're already witnessing MAS excel in diverse fields. They are instrumental in complex simulations, powering intelligent control systems for autonomous vehicles and smart grids, and driving data analysis and optimization across numerous industries. Ready to explore this powerful approach? Begin by familiarizing yourself with agent frameworks like JADE or AgentPy.

Another storm had passed, leaving the usual detritus: kelp, driftwood, and the occasional bewildered seabird. But this morning, nestled amongst the tide’s offerings, was something utterly alien. It was a rolled parchment, not brittle with age, but strangely supple, and it pulsed with a soft, aquamarine light. Unfurling it carefully, Elias found it was a map, unlike any he’d ever seen. Stars, rendered in luminous ink, swirled around islands that defied earthly geography. A single, brilliant X marked a spot in the vast, uncharted ocean. Elias, a man who had spent fifty years charting predictable waves, felt a thrill of the unknown course through him. The lighthouse, his steadfast companion, seemed to hum with a new, secret purpose.\nCriticAgent > Here's a critique of the story:\n\n**Plot:** The plot is intriguing, setting up a classic mystery/adventure scenario. The discovery of the map is a strong inciting incident that immediately raises questions and sparks curiosity. However, the plot is currently very short and lacks any development beyond the initial discovery. It ends on a note of anticipation, which is good, but leaves the reader wanting more.\n\n**Characters:** Elias is presented as a solitary, experienced individual whose life has been predictable until this point. This contrast makes his reaction to the map, the \"thrill of the unknown,\" more impactful. We get a sense of his established routine through the mention of his logbook and charting predictable waves. The lighthouse is also personified, acting as a \"steadfast companion\" that now seems to have a \"new, secret purpose.\" This adds a touch of atmosphere but doesn't develop Elias further.\n\n**Pacing:** The pacing is very quick, almost too quick, given the story's brevity. The discovery and Elias's immediate reaction happen in rapid succession. While this creates immediate engagement, it doesn't allow for much build-up or exploration of Elias's internal state beyond the initial thrill.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Expand on Elias's reaction and contemplation:** Instead of Elias immediately feeling a \"thrill,\" show him grappling with the impossibility of the map. Does he doubt his eyes? Does he try to rationalize it? This would add depth to his character and make his eventual acceptance of the adventure more earned. For example, he could compare the map to his known charts, try to decipher any symbols, or even feel a pang of fear before excitement.\n2.  **Introduce an immediate obstacle or decision point:** The story ends with the implication of a journey, but there's no immediate consequence or decision Elias has to make. Does he have the means to pursue this? Is there a risk involved? Even a small detail like him looking at his small boat, wondering if it's seaworthy for such a voyage, could propel the plot forward and create immediate tension.\n3.  **Hint at the map's origin or purpose:** While the mystery is part of the appeal, a very subtle clue about the map's nature—perhaps an inscription he initially overlooked, or a specific symbol that resonates with a forgotten legend—could add another layer of intrigue without revealing too much. This could be something Elias vaguely recalls or something that sparks a memory.\nRefinerAgent > Elias traced the salt-crusted lines of his worn logbook, the familiar ritual a balm against the sea's ceaseless roar. Fifty years he'd charted the predictable swells and charted the known world from his lonely perch. Another storm had passed, leaving the usual detritus: kelp, driftwood, and the occasional bewildered seabird. But this morning, nestled amongst the tide’s offerings, was something utterly alien. It was a rolled parchment, not brittle with age, but strangely supple, and it pulsed with a soft, aquamarine light.\n\nHe’d seen sea-worn treasures before, but this… this was different. Unfurling it carefully on the rough-hewn table of his lighthouse, Elias found it was a map, unlike any he’d ever seen. Stars, rendered in luminous ink, swirled around islands that defied earthly geography, their coastlines impossibly sharp, their peaks alien. A single, brilliant X marked a spot in the vast, uncharted ocean. Elias blinked, rubbing his eyes. He pulled out his most detailed charts, comparing them with growing disbelief. The familiar continents were there, but interspersed with phantom archipelagos, seas that should have been land, and land that should have been sea.\n\nA low hum seemed to emanate from the parchment, a resonant frequency that vibrated in his very bones. He ran a trembling finger over a symbol near the X, a spiral that seemed to writhe under his touch. It stirred a flicker of a half-forgotten dream, a tale his grandmother used to whisper, of a place beyond the world’s edge. Fear, cold and sharp, pricked at him, a sensation alien to his stoic nature. This was madness. This map was a phantom, a trick of the light and his aging eyes.\n\nYet, the map *glowed*. And the lighthouse, his steadfast companion for half a century, seemed to hum with a new, secret purpose, its beam cutting through the morning mist with an unusual fervor. Elias looked from the impossible map to the sturdy, weathered hull of his small fishing boat, bobbing in the cove. It had weathered countless storms, but could it brave a journey into the unknown, guided by a star-chart from another realm? The question hung in the air, as vast and daunting as the ocean itself. The thrill of the unknown, once a distant murmur, now thundered within him, a siren’s call he could no longer ignore.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.

You're Now an Agent Orchestrator\n\nIn this notebook, you made the leap from a single agent to a **multi-agent system**.\n\nYou saw **why** a team of specialists is easier to build and debug than one \"do-it-all\" agent. Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n\nYou used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n### 📚 Learn More\n\nRefer to the following documentation to learn more:\n\n- [Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)\n- [Sequential Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents/)\n- [Parallel Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/)\n- [Loop Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/)\n- [Custom Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/custom-agents/)\n\n### 🎯 Next Steps\n\nReady for the next challenge?
