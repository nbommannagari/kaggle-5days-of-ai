For decades, the primary focus in drug development was on **small molecule drugs**. These are relatively simple chemical compounds that can often be taken orally and are designed to interact with specific proteins inside cells.\n\nHowever, the \"low-hanging fruit\" for small molecule drugs has largely been picked. Many diseases are caused by complex biological processes involving larger molecules, or by genetic issues that small molecules can't easily address. This is where the expansion into new modalities comes in.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what this means and why it's a major development:\n\n**What are \"Modalities\" in Drug Discovery?**\n\n\"Modality\" refers to the type of therapeutic agent being developed. Think of it as the *form* of the medicine and how it works.\n\n**1. Small Molecules (The Traditional Approach):**\n*   **How they work:** Bind to proteins, enzymes, or receptors to either activate or inhibit their function.\n*   **Examples:** Aspirin, statins, most cancer chemotherapies.\n*   **Limitations:** Can struggle to reach certain cellular compartments, may have off-target effects, and can't directly address genetic defects.\n\n**2. Biologics (Expanding Area):**\n*   **What they are:** Large, complex molecules produced by living organisms.\n*   **Key examples and their impact:**\n    *   **Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs):** These are highly specific antibodies engineered to target particular proteins on cell surfaces or circulating in the bloodstream. They are incredibly successful in treating cancers, autoimmune diseases (like rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease), and infectious diseases.\n        *   **AI's Role:** AI helps identify ideal antibody targets, design antibody sequences for better binding and lower immunogenicity, and predict their efficacy.\n    *   **Proteins and Enzymes:** Using engineered proteins as therapeutics.\n        *   **AI's Role:** Designing novel protein structures with therapeutic functions.\n\n**3. Peptide Therapeutics:**\n*   **What they are:** Shorter chains of amino acids than proteins, but longer than small molecules. They can bridge the gap between small molecules and biologics.\n*   **Advantages:** Often more specific than small molecules, can be easier to manufacture than large antibodies, and can sometimes be delivered via injection or even inhaled.\n*   **Examples:** Some hormones and hormone-like drugs.\n*   **AI's Role:** Designing novel peptide sequences with improved stability and targeted delivery.\n\n**4. RNA-Based Therapies (Revolutionary Area):**\n*   **What they are:** Therapies that utilize RNA (ribonucleic acid) to influence gene expression.\n*   **Key examples and their impact:**\n    *   **mRNA Therapies:** Most famously known for COVID-19 vaccines, mRNA can instruct cells to produce specific proteins (like antigens for vaccines or therapeutic proteins).\n        *   **AI's Role:** Designing more stable and effective mRNA sequences, optimizing delivery mechanisms (like lipid nanoparticles), and predicting immune responses.\n    *   **siRNA (small interfering RNA) and Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASOs):** These therapies work by silencing or blocking specific genes that are causing disease.\n        *   **AI's Role:** Identifying the precise RNA sequences to target, designing stable RNA molecules, and predicting off-target effects.\n*   **Significance:** These therapies can potentially treat diseases at their genetic root, offering hope for conditions previously considered untreatable.\n\n**5. Gene Therapies:**\n*   **What they are:** Therapies that involve introducing, removing, or altering genetic material within a patient's cells to treat or cure diseases.\n*   **Examples:** Treatments for rare genetic disorders like spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and certain types of blindness.\n*   **AI's Role:** Identifying optimal gene targets, designing viral vectors (the delivery vehicles for genes) that are safe and efficient, and predicting the long-term effects of gene edits.\n\n**Why is this a \"New Development\" and Why is AI Crucial Here?**\n\n*   **Complexity:** These new modalities are inherently more complex than small molecules. Designing and optimizing them requires understanding intricate biological systems.\n*   **Vast Design Space:** The number of possible sequences and structures for proteins, peptides, and RNA is astronomical. Manually exploring this space is impossible.\n*   **Data Requirements:** Developing these therapies generates massive amounts of complex biological data.\n*   **AI as an Enabler:** AI is **essential** for:\n    *   **Making sense of the complexity:** AI can identify patterns and relationships in biological data that humans might miss.\n    *   **Navigating the design space:** AI algorithms can efficiently search for optimal sequences and structures.\n    *   **Predicting performance:** AI can forecast how a new biologic, peptide, or RNA molecule will behave *in vivo* (in the body), reducing the need for extensive experimental screening.\n    *   **Speeding up development:** By automating design, prediction, and analysis, AI significantly shortens the time from concept to potential clinical candidate.\n\nIn summary, the move beyond just small molecules to biologics, peptides, RNA therapies, and gene therapies represents a broadening of the therapeutic toolbox. AI is the engine that makes this expansion feasible and efficient, unlocking the potential to treat a much wider range of diseases with greater precision and effectiveness.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies at the forefront of developing these **advanced therapeutic modalities** (biologics, peptides, RNA, gene therapies) and, crucially, those leveraging **AI** to do so.\n\nIt's a dynamic landscape, but here are the key players and categories:\n\n**1.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
